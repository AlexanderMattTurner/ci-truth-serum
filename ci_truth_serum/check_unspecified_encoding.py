"""Flag a text-mode filesystem call that does not name its encoding.

``Path.read_text()`` / ``write_text()`` / ``open()`` with no ``encoding=``
decode with the platform default (``locale.getencoding()``), which is not
UTF-8 on every host, so a file holding an em-dash mis-decodes there and
nowhere else. Also flags a ``tempfile.{NamedTemporaryFile,TemporaryFile,
SpooledTemporaryFile}`` opened in text mode, which defaults to binary.

A VIOLATION is a call with no ``encoding`` supplied, by keyword or
positionally:

- ``<anything>.read_text(...)`` — ``encoding`` is positional arg 0
- ``<anything>.write_text(...)`` — ``encoding`` is positional arg 1 (after ``data``)
- builtin ``open(...)`` in text mode (no ``b`` in the mode) — ``encoding`` is arg 3
- ``tempfile.{NamedTemporaryFile,TemporaryFile,SpooledTemporaryFile}(...)`` in
  text mode — these default to BINARY (``w+b``); ``encoding`` is positional arg 2

Where the AST cannot decide, this check prefers a false negative over a
false positive: a non-constant mode (``open(p, mode)``) is unknown
text-vs-binary — not flagged. A ``*args`` / ``**kwargs`` splat could carry
the encoding — not flagged. ``<obj>.open(...)`` is NOT flagged: the method
name is shared by ``Path.open``, ``tarfile.open(p, "w:gz")`` and
``gzip.open``, whose mode grammars differ.

INVARIANT — ``encoding=None`` is no encoding; it selects the platform
default. A file that does not parse whole falls back to a per-line
best-effort scan (``_py_ast.trees``) rather than being reported clean.

Every hit here fails: this check ships no baseline and no grandfathering.
Exempt a justified case with ``# allow-unspecified-encoding: <reason>`` on
either of the two lines the call itself owns — its method-name line, or the
line its argument list closes on.
