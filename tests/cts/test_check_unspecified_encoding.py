"""Tests for ci_truth_serum/check_unspecified_encoding.py — the lint that requires
an explicit `encoding=` on every text-mode filesystem call.

Drives ``violations()`` directly so each rule is asserted in isolation. The
undecidable shapes get their own cases: this lint's whole design is to prefer
a false negative over a false positive, so a case that stops firing is a
regression only if it is one of the DECIDABLE ones.
