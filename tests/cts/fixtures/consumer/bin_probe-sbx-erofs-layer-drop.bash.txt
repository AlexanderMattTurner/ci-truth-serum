#!/bin/bash
# Hand-run repro hunt for docker/sbx-releases#366: the erofs snapshotter
# silently dropping image layers when an image is loaded STACKED ON a
# previously-cached base chain — the exact shape of every glovebox launch (the
# kit's guardrail layers sit on the pinned sandbox-templates base, which stays
# cached in sbx's store between loads).
#
# Each round reproduces that condition end-to-end with the shipped machinery:
# purge the loaded kit template and its freshness markers (the base chain stays
# cached — that is the trigger condition), then run a real launch to handover.
# The launch reloads the kit onto the cached chain and the create-time layer
# gate (sbx_verify_image_layers → sbx-kit/image/verify-layers.sh) verifies every
# baked layer inside the booted VM. A round whose output carries the gate's
# missing-layer signature IS the repro: the probe fails loud and points at the
# offending round's log. Rounds that all pass report the drop unreproduced at
# this count — evidence, not proof, of a healthy snapshotter.
#
# Tunables (env): _GLOVEBOX_EROFS_ROUNDS (launches, default 3).
#
# Requires: docker, sbx (logged in), git, KVM. Boots throwaway microVMs; removes
# every sandbox and temp dir it created on exit. The template purge between
# rounds is the probe's point, so the first post-probe launch pays one rebuild.
#
# Usage: bash bin/probe-sbx-erofs-layer-drop.bash
#
# This is a MANUAL probe, not a wired live check. It is deliberately NOT in
# .github/sbx-live/checks.json: every round pays a full template save/load plus
# a microVM boot (minutes each), and the drop it hunts is a version-specific
# upstream defect, not a per-PR regression surface — the durable per-launch
# protection is the create-time gate itself, which runs on every real launch.
# Run this on demand when validating a docker-sbx version bump against #366.
