# The review merge gate, as ONE stateless predicate: a PR is clear to merge when
# (a) at least one review of it BY THE AUTOMATED REVIEWER stands undismissed AND
# (b) no unresolved reviewer-rooted review thread still carries a merge-gating
# finding (config/review-severities.json says which severities gate). Resolving
# the last gating thread is what flips the gate — there is no sticky verdict to
# supersede, and no state beyond what the PR itself shows.
#
# Clause (a) is the whole reason a merge cannot outrun the reviewer: the cheap
# checks finish in about ninety seconds while an LLM review takes minutes, so a
# PR gated only on those merges first and the reviewer's findings arrive on a
# merged PR. It is PR-SCOPED, not head-scoped, and that is load-bearing: the
# reviewer does not read every push, so a head-scoped clause would hold a
# reviewed PR at unreviewed forever the moment a push produced a head nothing
# will review.
#
# The severity of a thread is read from the root comment the reviewer posted:
# the hidden `<!-- severity: … -->` marker the reviewer stamps on every finding,
# with the finding's leading 🔴/🟡/🔵 icon as a fallback for threads posted
# before the marker existed. Which severities gate — and which icon each renders
# as — comes from config/review-severities.json. The reviewer runs from
# AlexanderMattTurner/agent-review and renders findings from ITS copy of that
# model; the copy here decides only what holds a merge in this repository.
#
# sparse-checkout-needs: config/review-severities.json
#
# Two modes, one predicate:
#   * REPORT_SHA set — post the verdict as a COMMIT STATUS under the context
#     "$GATE_CONTEXT" on that sha (the PR head), so the ruleset's required check
#     is satisfied, pending or red there. Exit 0 once the status is posted,
#     whatever the verdict; a failure to POST it is a hard red (a gate that
#     cannot report is a gate that hangs the PR at "Expected").
#   * REPORT_SHA unset — exit 0 when the gate is green, 1 otherwise. This is the
#     merge_group mode: the calling job is itself the check on the queue sha,
#     so its exit status is the report, and a queue has no way to say `pending`.
#
# Three verdicts, two of which hold the merge. An unreviewed PR posts `pending`
# rather than `failure`: the review is coming, and a red there would send a
# reader off to diagnose a gate that is merely waiting. Unresolved findings post
# `failure`, because that one IS something to act on.
#
# A STATUS, not a check run, and that distinction is load-bearing: a check run
# POSTed for a bare sha lands in a check suite of the app's own making, whose
# `pull_requests` array is empty, and the PR-scoped merge box counts only the
# suites tied to the pull request. Such a run shows green on the commit and in
# the Checks tab while the required context sits at "Expected — Waiting for
# status to be reported" forever. A status carries no suite and is read on the
# sha itself.
#
# GATE_UNREPORTED set skips the predicate entirely and posts a RED verdict on
# REPORT_SHA — the caller's `always()` arm for a run that died before it could
# evaluate, so a required check is never left unreported.
#
# Can't-verify is RED, never green: an API failure exhausting the retry ladder
# propagates as a non-zero exit (set -e), because a gate that fails open lets a
# PR merge past findings nobody read.
#
# Env: GH_TOKEN, GH_REPO (owner/name), PR; REPORT_SHA, RUN_URL and
# GATE_UNREPORTED optional.
