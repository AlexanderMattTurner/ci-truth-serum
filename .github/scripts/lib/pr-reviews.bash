# The GraphQL review read behind the merge gate: the document plus the reviewer
# filter that answer "what has the automated reviewer posted on this PR?". Kept in
# a lib rather than inline so the pagination cannot be dropped — a
# `reviews(first: 100)` with no cursor returns the OLDEST 100 reviews and reports
# a stale state as the live one.
#
# Consumers: review-findings-gate.sh calls reviewer_reviews_ndjson.
# approve-if-reviewer-hold-clear.sh and detect-reviewer-body-hold.sh run
# REVIEWS_QUERY with their own jq: each needs the reviewer's latest review
# state, including a body-less one, which reviewer_reviews_ndjson drops.

# retry_stdout and the reviewer predicate: sourced here rather than assumed, so a
# consumer gets both by sourcing this file alone. Each is idempotent under a
# second source.

# $endCursor + pageInfo are what make `gh api graphql --paginate` able to walk:
# gh feeds the previous page's endCursor back in and stops on hasNextPage=false.
# Drop either and gh has no cursor to advance, so it returns page one forever —
# and page one of `reviews` is the OLDEST page, so an unpaginated query on a
# long-lived PR reports a superseded review as the current state.
