# The PR review-thread read, in ONE place: the GraphQL document plus the
# `gh api graphql --paginate` call that walks it. Every step that needs a PR's
# review threads goes through fetch_review_threads, so no caller can ship a
# `reviewThreads(first: 100)` with no cursor — a query that silently drops every
# thread past the first page and reports the truncated slice as the whole set.
# Callers differ only in the jq they project each page's nodes through.
#
# Consumer: review-findings-gate.sh.

# retry_stdout and the reviewer predicate: sourced here rather than assumed, so a
# consumer gets both by sourcing this file alone. Each is idempotent under a
# second source.

# $endCursor + pageInfo are what make `gh api graphql --paginate` able to walk:
# gh feeds the previous page's endCursor back in and stops on hasNextPage=false.
# Drop either and gh has no cursor to advance, so it returns page one forever.
#
# The node selection is the UNION of what the consumers project, because one
# shared document is the point — a few scalars a given caller ignores are far
# cheaper than a second copy of the query. The comment page is the one field with
# a per-page cost proportional to its size, so it is a variable: a caller keying on
# who OPENED each thread takes the root comment alone (the default), and one
# rendering the whole conversation for a model asks for more.
